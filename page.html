      <h3>Course Information</h3>
      <p>This course provides an introduction to critical and ethical issues surrounding data and society. 
      It blends social and historical perspectives on data with ethics, policy, and case examples—from Facebook’s “Emotional Contagion”
      experiment to search engine algorithms to self-driving cars—to help students develop a workable understanding of current ethical 
      issues in data science. Ethical and policy-related concepts addressed include: research ethics; privacy and surveillance; data 
      and discrimination; and the “black box” of algorithms. Importantly, these issues will be addressed throughout the lifecycle 
      of data—from collection to storage to analysis and application.</p>

    <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
    <p>Upon completion of the course, students will 1) identify and articulate some basic ethical and 
    policy-based frameworks; 2) understand the relationship between data, ethics, and society; and 
    3) be able to critically assess their own work and education in the area of data science. 
    In particular, course assignments will emphasize researcher and practitioner reflexivity, allowing students 
    to explore their own social and ethical 
    commitments as future data scientists and information professionals.</p>

    <h3>Assignments:</h3>
<p>Course	assignments	revolve	around short,	accessible	styles	of	writing.	Emphasis	is	placed	not	on
writing	for	academics,	but	in	writing	for	the	broad	potential	audiences	a	data	scientists	or	
information	professional	might	have	the	opportunity	to	engage—for	example,	co-workers,	
clients,	or	the	general	public.	Assignments	include	both	reflective	writing	(to	get	students	
thinking	through	their	own	ethical	commitments	and	practices)	and	compelling	argumentation	
(as	in	the	form	of	a	critical	or	persuasive	blog post	or	newspaper	op-ed).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Short	Writing	Assignment	#1 – Sketching	Your	Data	Double:	In	this	brief	personal	essay	(300	
words),	students	will	identify	a	data-intensive	online	service	they	regularly	use	(i.e.,	
Facebook,	Google,	reddit,	etc...)	and	describe	how	the	site	“sees”	them,	that	is,	students	
should	offer	a	description	of	who	or	what	the	site	“thinks”	they	are	like.</li>
<li>Short	Writing	Assignment	#2 - Values	Exploration:	In	this	brief	writing	assignment	(400-500	
words),	students	will	choose	one of	the	three	values	identified	in	the	Belmont	Report	
(respect,	beneficence,	or	justice)	and	1)	describe	how	it	is	defined	in	the	Report,	2)	conduct	
light	research	to	identify	a	different	or	alternative	definition	of	the	value,	and	3)	reflect	on	
what	it	might	mean	to	heed	this	value	in	the	context	of	data	science.</li>
<li>Group	Project – Student-Generated	Session:	Recognizing	the	value	of	diverse	inputs	and	
community	engagement,	students	will	be	split	into	four	groups	and	tasked	with	developing	
(with	assistance	from	the	instructor)	content	for	one	Module of	the	course.	These	student-
generated	sessions	will	span	two	sessions,	with	individual	groups	being	responsible	for	the	
content	(i.e.,	selected	reading,	reading	notes,	and	short	presentation)	for	half	of	one	
session. Though	students	will	have	relatively	broad	license,	they	will	be	required	to	work	
towards	the	pedagogical	aims	and	content	themes	of	the	Module (see	Modules	13	and	14	
below).</li>
<li>Final	Essay	Proposal:	Students	will	sketch	a	brief	idea	(300	word	max)	for	their	final	essay	
topic	(see	below).	This	proposal	process	will	give	the	students	an	opportunity	to	think	about	
their	final	project	in	advance	and	allow	the	instructor	to	give	them	constructive	feedback	
early	on.</li>
<li>Final	Essay	Project:	Students	(either	alone	or	in	pairs) will	write	an	extended	essay	(1200	
words)	on	the	topic	of	their	choosing	(so	long	as	the	topic	relates	to	ethics	and	data,	broadly	
construed).	The	essays	should	take	the	form	of	1)	a	blog	post,	of	the	sort	that	might	be	
circulated	online	or	on	an	internal company	blog	or	2)	op-ed	commentary	for	a	newspaper	
or	online	publication.	Students	should	have	a	clear	idea	of	their	intended	audience,	and	will	
receive	guidance	on	how	to	write	persuasively	in	that	direction.	Overall,	the	assignment	is	
intended	to	help	students	learn	to	communicate	ethical	ideas	and	critical	issues	outside	of	
the	classroom.</li>
</ul>  

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The	high	academic	standard	at	the	University	of	California,	Berkeley,	is	reflected	in	each	degree	
that	is	awarded.	As	a	result,	every	student	is	expected	to	maintain	this	high	standard	by	
ensuring	that	all	academic	work	reflects	unique	ideas	or	properly	attributes	the	ideas	to	the	
original	sources.	Individual	departments	often	have	their	own	ways	of	citing	and	attributing	
work,	so	it	is	the	responsibility	of	each	student	to	seek	that	information	out	if	it	is	not	otherwise	
provided	through	a	syllabus,	course	website,	or	other	means.</p>
<p>These	are	some	basic	expectations	of	students with	regards	to	academic	integrity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any	work	submitted	should	be	your	own	individual	thoughts,	and	should	not	have	been
submitted	for	credit	in	another	course	unless	you	have	prior	written permission	to	re-
use	it	in	this	course	from	this	instructor.</li>
<li>All	assignments	must	use	"proper	attribution," meaning	that	you	have	identified	the
original	source	and	extent	or	words	or	ideas	that	you	reproduce	or	use	in	your	
assignment.	This	includes	drafts	and	homework	assignments!</li>
<li>If	you	are	unclear	about	expectations,	ask	your	instructor	or	GSI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do	not	collaborate	or	work	with	other	students	on	assignments	or	projects	unless	you	have	
been	given	permission	or	instruction	to	do	so. For	more	information	visit:
